<br/>

#### table
this web uses 2 table, consisting of Users and Category

![Alt Text](https://github.com/ADR-ian-ba/assets/blob/main/ss3.png?raw=true)

the query used to create the script is as  follows 

CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1), 
    name VARCHAR(255), 
    email VARCHAR(255), 
    password VARCHAR(255)
);


CREATE TABLE Category (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    user_id INT,
    category_name VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES [Users] (id)
);

#### important !!!

the password will be hashed, so it is reccomended to just register using the front end to minimize the error potential

<br/>

for the  category however, if you create 1 user, the query for inserting data wll be



INSERT INTO Category (user_id, category_name)
VALUES
    (1, 'Book'),
    (1, 'Plate'),
    (1, 'Clothing'),
    (1, 'Electronics'),
    (1, 'Furniture');

note:(you can modify number 1 to be id of user in your database)

<br/>

#### dependency installation
###### api
when opening the file, please install the required dependency first

```bash
#navigate to api directory
./desktop/wearhousejs/wearhouseapi

#install required dependencymanually usi
dotnet restore

#run the api
dotnet run watch
```
after installing the required dependency and setting up the data base, the next and most important thing to do is to pray so the api works on "your" machine and not only on "my" machine ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

###### client
similar for api, the client uses react and have its own required dependency

```bash
#navigate to client directory
./desktop/wearhousejs/wearhouseclient

#install dependency
npm i  #can also use npm install

#run the client
npm run dev
```
